# SDSC HPC USER Training:  Spring 2020
## WEEK 5: 02/07/2020

## TOPIC: Intro to Parallel Computing: OpenMP/Threads/MPI 
* PRESENTED BY:  [Mary Thomas, SDSC](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/instr_bios/mary_thomas.html)

## READING AND PRESENTATIONS:

Source code and Instructions:
Tarfile: [hpc.mpi.tar](hpc.mpi.tar)
Source: [hpc.mpi](hpc.mpi)

* [TBD](TBD)


## WEEK 5 TASKS:
### TASK 1:  Compiling OpenMP Code

### TASK 2:  Compiling MPI Code
Note: These are the same projects that you were asked to do for the OpenMP topic.

1. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' examples source codes on your laptop. (if MPI runs on your laptop)
2. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on your laptop (if MPI runs on your laptop)
3. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on Comet and run it as a batch job. 


### TASK 3:  Executing Hybrid Codes 
*  NOTE: TO BE UPDATED for 2020 class: 
* Write a small program to perform a matrix-vector operation and then parallelize the code with OpenMP. Solve the exercise invloving the Hilbert matrix described at the end of the presentation slides.
